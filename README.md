# MiniBoone Classification Project 

Our topic for this project is about the neutrino classification from the ongoing experiment at Fermilab called MiniBooNE. For those unfamiliar with particle physics, you may remember from your physics class that atoms are composed of 3 subatomic particles, the proton, neutron, and electron. 

However, under the Standard Model, the proton and neutron are actually a composition of up and down quarks, as well as defining other elementary particles, like the photon, neutrino, or Higgs boson. The Standard Model provides a framework that defines all the elementary particles and their properties, and from this, we can explain everything in our universe. This claim is substantiated by multiple winners of the Nobel Prize for Physics for contributing to the Standard Model. 

Historically, neutrinos were believed to have zero mass. There are different types of neutrinos and through experimentation, physicists have detected that one type of neutrino can change to a different type after the neutrino has travelled some distance. Given the term neutrino oscillation, the overarching hypothesis to explain this property is that neutrinos have distinct masses.

In this dataset, we have 130K observations with 50 features. The features are measurements of Cherenkov light and scintillation light using hit topology and timing. There are 36.5K observations for electron neutrinos and 93.5K observations for muon neutrinos, which yields an imbalance ratio of 0.39.
