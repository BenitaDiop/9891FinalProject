# MiniBoone Classification Project 

In this dataset, we have 130K observations with 50 features. The features are measurements of Cherenkov light and scintillation light using hit topology and timing. There are 36.5K observations for electron neutrinos and 93.5K observations for muon neutrinos, which yields an imbalance ratio of 0.39.
